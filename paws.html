		<p>My coworkers and I did volunteered at PAWS Chicago Animal Shelter. We cleaned, organized shipment of donated animal food, and met some adorable cats and dogs.</p>
		<h3>"EVERY LIFE COUNTS.</h3>
		<h3>Once safe at PAWS Chicago, every pet is treated as an individual and guaranteed life, no matter where they come from and what they need." - PAWS Chicago</h3>
		<p>There are so many cats and dogs born but so few are adopted. Thousands of pets are in shelters that are waiting for a home.</p>
		<p>Visit pawschicago.org for more information on pets fostering or adoption.</p>
